                            While Josh was not an original member of "Zack and the Boys 2.0", he earned his spot among the ranks by offering suggestions, debugging, and styling.  Although this is not the project he signed up for, he proved himself to be an honorary member, and an important part of the team.

                            Josh lives in Renton, Washington.  He is looking for a nice girl that he can introduce his parents to.  Although not required, a girl with a sense of humor is prefered in order to keep up with Josh's quick wit and joyful outlook on life.  Josh is a man of confidence; he is more than willing to show off his lean body and stunning tattoos.  Who needs to buy a fan when you can just pop your shirt off when you get too hot?  That's just the way Josh lives his life.  A lover of travel, the sun, and good times - any girl would be happy to have him in her life.  Josh is also an avid follower of the Church of Nick Quandt.  Josh, "the-man-that-has-everything", is just missing one thing. . . a lucky lady that is enjoys life as much as he does.
